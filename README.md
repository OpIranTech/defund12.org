### Email templates

Please **review our [email template style guide](EMAIL_TEMPLATE_STYLE_GUIDE.md)**. All messages go through basic fact-checking and editorial review before they are published. Following the style guide makes this process go quicker!

NOTE: If possible, limit one email template per PR. This make it easier to process the history of whatâ€™s entering the codebase, and takes some strain off the reviewer.

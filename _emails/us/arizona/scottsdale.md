  To Mayor-President Jim Lane and the Scottsdale City Council:
  
  My name is [INSERT NAME] and I am a resident of [YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am writing to demand that the Scottsdale City Council adopt a budget that prioritizes community well-being, and redirects funding away from the police.

  In the most recent city budget, a staggering $106 million was allocated to the Scottsdale police department [1]. Latinx people comprise 31% of Arizona’s resident population, but are disproportionately sentenced for drug for marijuana distribution, representing 42% of arrests for marijuana distribution and 81.5% of the people sent to prison for distribution [2].

  The current budget signals that law enforcement (1/3 of the budget) is almost three times more important than community outreach, and I do not believe that this aligns with most residents' values. I demand that we reallocate funds from the police department to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community and to address economic disparities. Effective programs could include community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs, and more. We need a budget that reflects the actual needs of Scottsdale residents.

  History has shown that police “reform” is not enough. We must take a hard look at the ways that the current system in place fails to serve–and in fact actively harms–our community, and come together to reimagine the role of police in our city. I strongly urge you to remove funding from the police department and reallocate it to social services that make a meaningful difference for the people of Scottsdale.

  Sincerely,

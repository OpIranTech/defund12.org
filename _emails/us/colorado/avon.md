  Dear Avon Town Council,

  My name is [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE] and I am writing to demand the defunding of the Avon Police Department and reallocation to social and public programs for our community.

  The Avon Police Department was funded $4,320,911 for 2020. This is $401,758 more than in 2019 and is part of a trend of increasing police budgeting since at least 2010. The Avon Police Department has been increased a total of $1,756,764 since 2010. Additionally, the City of Rifle, Colorado, is budgeting $1,076,212 less for its police budget than Avon, despite Rifle's higher population. The Town of Avon's police spending is excessive and must be reallocated.

  I demand a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Avon residents. I call on you to meaningfully restrict the Avon Police Department budget and instead meaningfully reallocate funds towards social programs and resources that support health care, child care, education, affordable housing, and other critical community needs. We demand a budget that supports community well-being, rather than empowering the police forces that tear us apart.

  Sincerely,
  
  [YOUR NAME]

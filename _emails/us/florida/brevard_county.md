  Dear Brevard County Commissioners,

  My name is [YOUR NAME], a resident of Brevard County. I am writing to demand that the county commissioners adopt a budget that prioritizes community well-being and redirects funding away from the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office.

  The Brevard County Sheriff’s Department is asking for $1.33 billion for next year’s budget, over twice the budget of Brevard County schools. Reasons cited for the budget increases were outdated vehicles and “the cost of fighting the opioid crisis and the increased expense to help protect local schools in the wake of the Parkland shootings last year.” Both of these issues are problems that will not be solved by more officers with guns. These are issues that need to be alleviated by allocating more funds to rehabilitation programs for drug users and mental health services for students. Our schools are also underfunded, with the majority of Brevard County public school buildings being over 50 years old and need regular renovations, maintenance, and repairs.

  I urge Brevard County commissioners to provide for the health, safety, education, and other needs of the community. Shift funds from the Sheriff Department in order to have the budget to bolster educational needs, including educational infrastructure, mental health services, and job support.

  Thank you for your time,

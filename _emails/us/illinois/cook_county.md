  Dear President Toni Preckwinkle and Cook County Board of Commissioners,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD]. While I am glad to hear about Cook County passing a resolution to reduce police funding, I am writing to you today to demand the Cook County Board to set mandated deadlines and expectations for defunding the Cook County Sheriff's Office.

  According to the 2021 Cook County Preliminary Budget Forecast, the police departmentâ€™s budget is increasing to $75,308,817 from the 2020 approved and adopted $69,998,591. Police funding needs to instead be reduced and put towards programs like community development, COVID-19 care and economic relief, and education.

  Thank you for your support in defunding the police, and I look forward to hearing about the action steps the Cook County Board plans on taking.

  Sincerely,

  [YOUR NAME]

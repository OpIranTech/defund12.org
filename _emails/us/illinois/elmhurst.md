  Hello,

  My name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD/CITY]. I am extremely concerned with the City of Elmhurst’s inordinate investment in the Elmhurst Police Department (EPD) at the expense of critical youth, education, and health services. As demonstrated by ongoing peaceful protests and a 2019 Gallup poll, a majority of individuals living in Illinois view the police negatively.

  I am therefore writing to demand that the City Council vote to reapportion funds allocated to the EPD to support evidence-based programs and services that, unlike increased police presence, promote the well-being of citizens and reduce crime. It is morally reprehensible to dedicate 30% of the City’s operating budget towards policing while too many citizens are homeless and many more lack access to essential services, including clean running water and necessary mental health resources.

  I also urge the City Council to enact legislation that holds police accountable and to overturn policies that allow police to engage in unlawful behavior with impunity.

  People are marching in the streets because they know that these actions will result in a healthier, more just society. I implore you to please listen to the needs of your constituents and take immediate action to address their concerns.

  Thank you,

  My name is [NAME], and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD/TOWN]. I am writing to demand that the Whitpain Township Board of Supervisors implement a new budget that prioritizes our community's well-being and redirects funding away from police.

  The 2020 Whitpain Township budget proposal presentation indicated that the General Fund allocated $7.49 million to Police, making up 47% of the $15.9 million in total expenditures. This is an inordinate amount of funding, compared to the amount of funding that Public Works & Facilities ($3.8 million) and Parks & Recreation ($800,000) received.

  I demand that the township reallocate this funding to more meaningful community projects, such as community-based mental health services, affordable housing programs, and substance abuse treatment. Our budget ought to reflect the needs of our community.

  We have witnessed the glaring inadequacy of police departments across our country to truly serve and protect. Simple reforms are not enough to reduce police violence. We have the ability to reshape our communities, and that starts with rethinking the role of police.

  Sincerely,

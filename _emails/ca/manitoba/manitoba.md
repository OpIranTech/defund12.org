  My name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a resident of Manitoba.

  As you know, the Iranian people have been protesting and demanding the most rudimentary human rights (and consequently for an end to the Islamic Republic regime) since September 16th. The Islamic Republic has responded with a deadly crackdown, using military-grade weapons to kill hundreds of their citizens across Iran. Hundreds have been murdered and thousands arrested, tortured, or raped. This includes at least 60 children under the age of 17 who were killed in the last three months.
  
  The brutal crackdown has now entered an even darker phase where imprisoned protestors are expeditiously executed without due process, access to an independent lawyer, or the chance to request an appeal. Huundreds are at risk of execution by the regime. (More information about protestors who are sentenced to death is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YhwOE8R0Xb_-ZCJQdhiHCyJeNB5QlLwehZkA-9w2Vig/edit?usp=sharing)).
  
  The Islamic Republic has shown time and again that it is not above any [depravity](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2022/11/middleeast/iran-protests-sexual-assault/index.html) in order to stay in power and spread its demented ideology worldwide. And the Iranian people have made clear that they are not going to tolerate this regime any longer.
  
  It is time for Canada and the international community to take *concrete action* against the regime. This includes:
  
  - Immediate expulsion of all regime diplomats.
  - Immediate recall of ambassadors from Tehran.
  - Immediate imposition of sanctions against the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and all entities associated with him, and designation thereof as a terrorist entity.
  - Urging the United Nations to take immediate action, under the Responsibility to Protect, to respond to human rights violations against the innocent prisoners in Iran.

  While I understand that Canada has limited diplomatic relations with Iran, given its large population of Iranian-Canadians and longstanding commitment to human rights, I expect Canada to be a leading voice on the international scene on this matter.

  Thank you for your time and attention to this timely sensitive matter,

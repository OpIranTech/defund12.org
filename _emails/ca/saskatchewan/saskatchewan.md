  My name is [YOUR NAME], I am a resident of Saskatchewan.

  I am writing to demand that you stand with the people of Iran against the regime of the Islamic Republic. In the past, Western governments have paid lip service to solidarity with the people of Iran, but in the next breath, they have allowed regime officials to immigrate to western countries with millions of dollars of stolen money to live lives of luxury; they have, directly or indirectly through intermediaries, made deals with the Islamic Republic that have led to its sustenance.

  Iran is a country that has been held hostage by terrorists for over four decades. This regime is the number one state sponsor of terrorism in the Middle East. They have shot down passenger planes as a political maneuver. They regularly use torture and sadism as a means to maintain their grip on power. It is an outrage that all members of the regime apparatus are not recognized as terrorists, that deals continue to be made with them via backchannels, and that the support for the brave people of Iran has stopped at mere statements.

  I am standing with Iranian expatriates in Canada and around the world and with the the millions of Iranians who are bravely facing this regime on their streets.  I demand that yourself our PROVINCIAL/FEDERAL government meaningfully do the same by:

    - Formally recognizing the Islamic Republic as an illegitimate government and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization, 
    - Seizing the assets of Islamic Republic and all its agents and releasing them only to a legitimate government of Iran,
    - Formally declaring the severance of all engagement with the illegitimate regime.

  Today, I am vowing to reserve all my future votes to public officials and parties who stand with the brave people of Iran, regardless of all other considerations.

  Thank you for your time,
  [YOUR NAME] [ADDRESS]
  [PHONE NUMBER]
